# 1: How to determine above or below average in the datasets

# Calculate median number of characters: med_num_char
med_num_char <- median(email50$num_char)

# Create num_char_cat variable in email50
email50_fortified <- email50 %>%
  mutate(num_char_cat = ifelse(num_char < med_num_char, "below median", "at or above median"))

# Count emails in each category
email50_fortified %>%
  count(num_char_cat)

# 2: Use the if and else statement
# Create number_yn variable in email50
email50_fortified <- email50 %>%
  mutate(
    number_yn = case_when(
      # if number is "none", make number_yn "no"
      number == "none" ~ "no",
      # if number is not "none", make number_yn "yes"
      number != "none" ~ "yes"
    )
  )

# Visualize the distribution of number_yn
ggplot(email50_fortified, aes(x = number_yn)) +
  geom_bar()

# 3: Simpson paradox

ucb_admission_counts %>%
  # Group by gender
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  # Create new variable
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  # Filter for admitted
  filter(Admit == "Admitted")

# 4: practising mutate and filter function

ucb_admission_counts  %>%
  # Group by department, then gender
  group_by(Dept, Gender) %>%
  # Create new variable
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  # Filter for male and admitted
  filter(Gender == "Male", Admit == "Admitted")
