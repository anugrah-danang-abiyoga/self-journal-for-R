# 1: Conversion
# Make this evaluate to "character"
class("TRUE")

# Make this evaluate to "numeric"
class(8484.00)

# Make this evaluate to "integer"
class(99L)

# Make this evaluate to "factor"
class(factor("factor"))

# Make this evaluate to "logical"
class(FALSE)

# 2: using as. function
# Preview students with str()
str(students)

# Coerce Grades to character
students$Grades <- as.character(students$Grades)

# Coerce Medu to factor
students$Medu <- as.factor(students$Medu)

# Coerce Fedu to factor
students$Fedu <- as.factor(students$Fedu)

# Look at students once more with str()
str(students)

# 2: using dates and lubridate package
# Preview students2 with str()
str(students2)

# Load the lubridate package
library(lubridate)

# Parse as date
dmy("17 Sep 2015")

# Parse as date and time (with no seconds!)
mdy_hm("July 15, 2012 12:56")

# Coerce dob to a date (with no time)
students2$dob <- ymd(students2$dob)

# Coerce nurse_visit to a date and time
students2$nurse_visit <- ymd_hms(students2$nurse_visit)

# Look at students2 once more with str()
str(students2)

# 3 Using str_detect and str_replace
# Copy of students2: students3
students3 <- students2

# Look at the head of students3
head(students3)

# Detect all dates of birth (dob) in 1997
str_detect(students3$dob, "1997")

# In the sex column, replace "F" with "Female" ...
students3$sex <- str_replace(students3$sex, "F", "Female")

# ... and "M" with "Male"
students3$sex <- str_replace(students3$sex, "M", "Male")

# View the head of students3
head(students3)
